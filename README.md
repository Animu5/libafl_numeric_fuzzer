# LibAFL Numeric Fuzzer with OpenOCD Integration

## Project Overview

This project is a prototype LibAFL-based fuzzer that uses a numeric measurement instead of traditional code coverage as feedback.

The intended use case is to generate or mutate inputs for a RISC-V target and maximize a measured value such as power consumption.

The program communicates with the target through the OpenOCD Tcl interface.

## Current Implementation

The current implementation:

* connects to OpenOCD through TCP;
* uses the OpenOCD Tcl interface on port `6666`;
* loads an ELF program onto the target;
* writes fuzz input bytes into target RAM;
* resets the program counter before each execution;
* resumes target execution;
* reads a numeric measurement from the oscilloscope (VISA);
* treats an input as interesting when it produces a value higher than the previous best value;
* creates a `solutions/` directory and configures it as the LibAFL solutions corpus.

The corpus starts with a seed input (`--seed` file or directory of files, default 16 zero bytes) that is mutated with LibAFL's havoc mutators. Each input is written to target RAM before the run.

## Project Files

The main code is inside the `src` folder.

* `main.rs` contains the LibAFL setup, numeric feedback, measurement logic and fuzzing loop.
* `openocd.rs` contains the functions used to communicate with OpenOCD.

The repository also contains:

* `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` for the Rust dependencies;
* `solutions/`, which is created automatically when the program runs and is configured as the LibAFL solutions corpus;
* `RUNNING.md` with the setup and execution steps;
* `TODO.md` with the remaining work.

The current numeric feedback is used as normal corpus feedback. Therefore, inputs that produce a new best measurement are treated as interesting and added to the in-memory corpus. They are not currently written to the `solutions/` directory.

## How the Current Version Works

When the program starts, it connects to OpenOCD at:

`127.0.0.1:6666`

It then loads the target program from:

`<assembly-environment>/snippet.elf`

The current code uses:

* `0x80000000` as the program start address;
* `0x80010000` as the RAM address for the fuzz input.

Before the fuzzing loop starts, the program:

1. resets and initializes the target;
2. loads the ELF program;
3. sets the program counter to `0x80000000`;
4. reads an idle measurement from the oscilloscope;
5. resumes the target;
6. waits for 100 milliseconds;
7. reads a running measurement from the oscilloscope.

Once a seed input is available, each fuzzing iteration is intended to:

1. save the current input as `current_input.bin`;
2. reset and initialize the target through OpenOCD;
3. write the input into target RAM;
4. set the program counter;
5. resume the target;
6. wait for 100 milliseconds;
7. after the target execution finishes, the numeric feedback reads the latest value from the oscilloscope.

If the new measurement is higher than the previous best value, the input is treated as interesting and added to the in-memory corpus.

## Current Limitations

The current version is not yet a complete end-to-end setup.

The main limitations are:

* `ScopeMeasurement::measure` (arming and reading the scope) still has to be ported;
* the correct OpenOCD interface and target configuration still need to be selected;
* the hardware addresses still need to be confirmed on the final target;
* the target program must be modified or confirmed to read input from `0x80010000`;
* the full setup has not been tested on the final hardware.

The remaining work is listed in `TODO.md`.

The setup and run instructions are provided in `RUNNING.md`.
